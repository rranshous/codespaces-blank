docs are kept in the `docs` folder

some docs such as implementation progress and feature docs should be updated as features are added.

update the `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` as items are completed

build the project after change sets to make sure the changes are valid

complete each item within a milestone sequentially 

do not consider a milestone complete until it has built without errors

To understand the projects goals and the status of the work review the documents in the `docs` folder

our development process will a big cycle (working on milestones) followed by small cycle (reviewing and refining the implementation)

review the `docs/LESSONS.md` file before implementation cycles

do not remove features unless specificly instructed to

Keep files under 1000 lines

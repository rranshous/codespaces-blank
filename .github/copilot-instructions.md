docs are kept in the `docs` folder

some docs such as implementation progress and feature docs should be updated as features are added.

update the `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` as items are completed

build the project after change sets to make sure the changes are valid

complete each item within a milestone sequentially 

do not consider a milestone complete until it has built without errors

To understand the projects goals and the status of the work review the documents in the `docs` folder

our development process will a big cycle (working on milestones) followed by small cycle (reviewing and refining the implementation)

we will commit after each big and small cycle

do not remove features unless specificly instructed to

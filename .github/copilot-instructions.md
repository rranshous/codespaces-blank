docs are kept in the `docs` folder

some docs such as implementation progress and feature docs should be updated as features are added.

update the `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` as items are completed

build the project after change sets to make sure the changes are valid

complete each item within a milestone sequentially 

do not consider a milestone complete until it has built without errors

To understand the projects goals and the status of the work review the documents in the `docs` folder

for each version keep a record of tradeoffs made.

keep lessons learned during implementation in `docs/LESSONS.md`.

review the `docs/LESSONS.md` file before implementation cycles

Keep files under 1000 lines. if a file is longer than 1000 lines break it's functions out in to other objects or modules.

create all documents in markdown

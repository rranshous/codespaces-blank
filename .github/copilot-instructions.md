docs are kept in the `docs` folder

some docs such as implementation progress and feature docs should be updated as features are added.

update the `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` as implementation changes are made 

build the project after change sets to make sure the changes are valid

do not consider a milestone complete until it has built without errors

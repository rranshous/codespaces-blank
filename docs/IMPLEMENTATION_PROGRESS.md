## Recent Updates (April 19, 2025)

### Memory System Balance Improvements
- Adjusted memory importance calculation to make food memories equally important as energy memories
- Modified duplicate detection logic to use different distance thresholds for different resource types
- Food locations now use a smaller distance threshold (15 units vs 20 units) for duplicate detection
- This allows Sparklings to maintain more distinct food locations in memory
- Balances the typical ratio of food vs energy locations in Sparkling memory
- Prevents the previous issue where Sparklings would have many energy locations but few food locations
- Better reflects the actual resource distribution in the world
- Improves decision-making especially for hungry Sparklings who need to find food sources

### Memory Importance Parameters Integration
- Fixed issues with memory importance parameters not being properly passed between components
- Modified Sparkling constructor to pass foodMemoryImportance and energyMemoryImportance to Memory
- Updated the updateParameters method to synchronize Memory's importance values when parameters change
- Verified that the inference system properly includes memory importance parameters in the AI prompt
- Confirmed that both the "Current Instincts" section and "Response Format" section include these parameters
- Updated validation ranges and valid parameter names list in the inference system
- Updated the InferenceQualityTester to include these parameters in test cases
- This allows each Sparkling to maintain its own memory importance preferences
- Gatherer profile Sparklings (high food memory importance) now properly remember food locations better
- Energy Seeker profile Sparklings (high energy memory importance) now properly remember energy locations better
- The memory system now correctly applies the individual importance multipliers to calculate memory retention
- More important memories will be retained longer during memory pruning
- Memory importance parameters also affect how the inference system utilizes memories in decision-making

### Documentation Improvements
- Created a new LESSONS.md document to capture development lessons and best practices
- Documented the lesson about updating parameter-related code in multiple places when adding new parameters
- Added sections for Code Architecture, Memory System, Inference System, Performance Optimization, Testing, and Documentation
- This knowledge base will help prevent recurring issues and improve development processes
- Lessons document will be updated regularly as new insights are discovered during development

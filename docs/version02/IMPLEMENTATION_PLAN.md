# Sparklings: Version 2 Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation strategy for Version 2 of the Sparklings Neural Energy Simulation. Building on the foundation established in Version 1, this plan focuses on enhancing the existing systems with more sophisticated features, introducing Sparkling lifecycle mechanics, and improving the user experience with simulation speed controls.

#### Milestone 1.3: Fadeout Mechanics (1 week)
- Implement gradual fadeout process when energy reserves are depleted
- Create visual effects for Sparkling fadeout
- Add fadeout memory for other Sparklings (remembering where a Sparkling faded)
- Implement cleanup of faded Sparklings from the simulation
- Add fadeout statistics to the simulation metrics

### Phase 2: New Sparkling Formation & Dynamics (3 weeks)

- Implement territorial benefits (increased collection efficiency within own territory)
- Create territorial defense mechanics (higher chance of winning competitions in own territory)
- Develop territory establishment algorithms based on resource density
- Add territory visualization options
- Implement territory overlap detection and resolution

#### Milestone 3.3: Environmental Factors (1 week)
- Create seasonal resource patterns (cyclic abundance and scarcity)
- Implement regional variations in resource types
- Add environmental events that affect resource availability

- Implement selective visualization layers

## Development Approach

- Iterative development with frequent testing
- Each milestone should result in a working simulation
- Regular documentation updates
- Focus on user experience and accessibility
- Balance between realism and performance

## Success Criteria for Version 2

1. Sparklings demonstrate complete lifecycle with fadeout and new formation
2. The simulation can be accelerated to observe long-term patterns
3. Resource economy shows realistic depletion and regeneration
4. Competition and territories create meaningful behavioral patterns
5. User interface provides intuitive controls for managing simulation speed
6. Visualization clearly shows Sparkling states, territories, and resource quality

This Version 2 implementation plan builds upon the existing foundation while introducing more sophisticated features that enhance the emergent complexity and user engagement of the Sparklings Neural Energy Simulation.

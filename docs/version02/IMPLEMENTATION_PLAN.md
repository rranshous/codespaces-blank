# Sparklings: Version 2 Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation strategy for Version 2 of the Sparklings Neural Energy Simulation. Building on the foundation established in Version 1, this plan focuses on enhancing the existing systems with more sophisticated features, introducing Sparkling lifecycle mechanics, and improving the user experience with simulation speed controls.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Simulation Speed Controls (1 week)

#### Milestone 1.1: Speed Multiplier Implementation (1 week)
- Implement speed multiplier selector (1x, 2x, 5x, 10x)
- Create delta time scaling based on selected speed
- Implement frame skipping for very high speeds
- Add current speed display indicator
- Update simulation loop to handle variable time steps

### Phase 2: Sparkling Lifecycle Mechanics (2 weeks)

#### Milestone 2.1: Food Monitoring & Visualization (1 week)
- Improve visualization of existing food consumption mechanics
- Create clear visual indicators for low food states
- Create tooltip enhancements for food level monitoring
- Add improved UI elements for tracking food resources
- Enhance visibility of food-related Sparkling behaviors

#### Milestone 2.2: Fadeout & New Sparkling Mechanics (1 week)
- Enhance existing food and neural energy consumption relationship
- Implement gradual fadeout process when both food and neural energy are depleted
- Create visual effects for Sparkling fadeout
- Add fadeout memory for other Sparklings (remembering where a Sparkling faded)
- Implement mechanics for new Sparklings to appear
- Add population control to maintain ecosystem balance

### Phase 3: Enhanced Visualization & Analytics (2 weeks)

#### Milestone 3.1: Advanced Visualization Controls (1 week)
- Implement zoom and pan controls
- Create path visualization for Sparkling movement
- Develop memory visualization overlays
- Add animation improvements for states and interactions
- Implement selective visualization layers

#### Milestone 3.2: Analytics Dashboard (1 week)
- Create visual metrics for simulation-wide statistics
- Implement Sparkling population charts
- Develop resource distribution visualization

### Phase 4: Sparkling Inheritance & Evolution (2 weeks)

#### Milestone 4.1: Parameter Inheritance (1 week)
- Implement parameter inheritance from successful Sparklings
- Create parameter variation algorithm for new Sparklings
- Add visualization for parameter lineage
- Implement adaptation scoring to determine inheritance value
- Create history tracking for parameter evolution

#### Milestone 4.2: Evolution Mechanics (1 week)
- Implement selection pressures based on environment
- Create success metrics for different strategies
- Develop branching evolution visualization
- Add trait dominance and recessive mechanics
- Implement genetic diversity management

## Development Approach

- Iterative development with frequent testing
- Each milestone should result in a working simulation
- Regular documentation updates
- Focus on user experience and accessibility
- Balance between realism and performance

## Success Criteria for Version 2

1. The simulation can be accelerated to observe long-term patterns
2. Sparklings demonstrate complete lifecycle with fadeout and new formation
3. Visualization clearly shows Sparkling states, territories, and resource quality
4. New Sparklings inherit and evolve parameters from successful predecessors
5. User interface provides intuitive controls for managing simulation speed
6. Analytics provide meaningful insights into simulation dynamics

This Version 2 implementation plan builds upon the existing foundation while introducing more sophisticated features that enhance the emergent complexity and user engagement of the Sparklings Neural Energy Simulation.

# Sparklings: Version 2 Implementation Progress

This document tracks the implementation progress of Version 2 features for the Sparklings Neural Energy Simulation, building on the foundation established in Version 1.

## Phase 1: Simulation Speed Controls

### Milestone 1.1: Speed Multiplier Implementation
- [x] Speed multiplier selector (1x, 2x, 5x, 10x)
- [x] Delta time scaling based on selected speed
- [x] Frame skipping for very high speeds
- [x] Current speed display indicator
- [x] Simulation loop update for variable time steps

**Status**: Completed
**Completion Date**: April 19, 2025
**Notes**: Successfully implemented the speed multiplier functionality with UI controls, providing users the ability to observe simulation at different time scales. Added frame skipping for higher speeds (5x, 10x) to maintain performance while preserving simulation integrity. Speed is displayed in the debug panel and buttons highlight the current selection for clear user feedback.

**Context**: This milestone enables users to observe long-term patterns and behaviors by accelerating the simulation, which is crucial for research and observation. The variable time step handling ensures that the simulation behaves consistently regardless of the selected speed, allowing users to study both detailed behaviors at normal speed and emergent patterns at accelerated speeds.

## Phase 2: Sparkling Lifecycle Mechanics

### Milestone 2.1: Food Monitoring & Visualization
- [x] Improved visualization of existing food consumption mechanics
- [x] Clear visual indicators for low food states
- [x] Tooltip enhancements for food level monitoring
- [x] Improved UI elements for tracking food resources
- [x] Enhanced visibility of food-related behaviors

**Status**: Completed
**Completion Date**: April 19, 2025
**Notes**: Enhanced food monitoring and visualization by adding visual food level bars with threshold markers, detailed food consumption statistics, and time estimates to the tooltips. The improved tooltip system now shows color-coded food states, consumption rates, and clear indicators for critical hunger states. This makes it easier to monitor Sparkling food levels and anticipate when they need to seek food.

**Context**: This milestone improves user understanding of the food consumption system by providing clear visual indicators and detailed information. These enhancements enable users to better monitor the simulation health and understand Sparkling decision-making related to food resources, which is essential for observing and analyzing the ecosystem dynamics.

### Milestone 2.2: Fadeout & New Sparkling Mechanics
- [ ] Gradual fadeout process when both food and neural energy are depleted
- [ ] Visual effects for Sparkling fadeout

**Status**: Not started
**Expected Completion**: April 27, 2025
**Context**: This milestone will implement the fadeout mechanics for resource-depleted Sparklings, creating a more realistic lifecycle simulation. The visual effects will help users understand when Sparklings are disappearing from the simulation due to resource depletion.

### Milestone 2.3: Add new sparklings to replaced those which fade out
- [ ] Implement mechanics for new Sparklings to appear

**Status**: Not started
**Expected Completion**: May 1, 2025
**Context**: This milestone introduces the ability for new Sparklings to appear in the simulation, replacing those that have faded out. This creates a dynamic ecosystem with continuous population turnover, setting the stage for later evolution mechanics.

### Milestone 2.4: Population Control
- [ ] Add population control to maintain ecosystem balance

**Status**: Not started
**Expected Completion**: May 3, 2025
**Context**: This milestone completes the Sparkling lifecycle mechanics by implementing population control features that maintain the ecosystem's balance. This ensures the simulation remains stable over time while still allowing for natural turnover and evolution.

## Phase 3: Enhanced Visualization & Analytics

### Milestone 3.1: Advanced Visualization Controls
- [ ] Zoom and pan controls
- [ ] Path visualization for movement
- [ ] Memory visualization overlays
- [ ] Animation improvements
- [ ] Selective visualization layers

**Status**: Not started
**Expected Completion**: May 4, 2025
**Context**: This milestone will enhance the user's ability to observe and analyze Sparkling behavior through advanced visualization controls. These tools will enable users to focus on specific aspects of the simulation and track movement and decision patterns more effectively, improving the research and analysis capabilities of the platform.

### Milestone 3.2: Analytics Dashboard
- [ ] Simulation-wide statistics
- [ ] Population charts
- [ ] Resource distribution visualization

**Status**: Not started
**Expected Completion**: May 11, 2025
**Context**: This milestone will provide users with quantitative data and analytics about the simulation. The dashboard will enable the study of population dynamics, resource utilization patterns, and other emergent behaviors across the entire simulation, creating a more comprehensive understanding of the ecosystem as a whole.

## Phase 4: Sparkling Inheritance & Evolution

### Milestone 4.1: Parameter Inheritance
- [ ] Parameter inheritance from successful Sparklings
- [ ] Parameter variation algorithm
- [ ] Parameter lineage visualization
- [ ] Adaptation scoring
- [ ] Parameter evolution history

**Status**: Not started
**Expected Completion**: May 18, 2025
**Context**: This milestone will establish the foundation for evolutionary mechanics by enabling successful decision parameters to be passed from existing Sparklings to new ones, with controlled variation. This creates a system where natural selection can occur within the simulation as successful strategies are more likely to be passed on to subsequent generations.

### Milestone 4.2: Evolution Mechanics
- [ ] Selection pressures based on environment
- [ ] Success metrics for different strategies
- [ ] Branching evolution visualization
- [ ] Trait dominance and recessive mechanics
- [ ] Genetic diversity management

**Status**: Not started
**Expected Completion**: May 25, 2025
**Context**: This final milestone will complete the evolutionary system, allowing the simulation to demonstrate how different behavioral strategies evolve in response to environmental conditions and resource availability. This creates a comprehensive platform for studying adaptive behaviors and evolutionary processes in a controlled virtual ecosystem.

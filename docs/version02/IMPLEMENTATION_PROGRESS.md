# Sparklings: Version 2 Implementation Progress

This document tracks the implementation progress of Version 2 features for the Sparklings Neural Energy Simulation, building on the foundation established in Version 1.

## Phase 1: Simulation Speed Controls

### Milestone 1.1: Speed Multiplier Implementation
- [x] Speed multiplier selector (1x, 2x, 5x, 10x)
- [x] Delta time scaling based on selected speed
- [x] Frame skipping for very high speeds
- [x] Current speed display indicator
- [x] Simulation loop update for variable time steps

**Status**: Completed
**Completion Date**: April 19, 2025
**Notes**: Successfully implemented the speed multiplier functionality with UI controls, providing users the ability to observe simulation at different time scales. Added frame skipping for higher speeds (5x, 10x) to maintain performance while preserving simulation integrity. Speed is displayed in the debug panel and buttons highlight the current selection for clear user feedback.

**Context**: This milestone enables users to observe long-term patterns and behaviors by accelerating the simulation, which is crucial for research and observation. The variable time step handling ensures that the simulation behaves consistently regardless of the selected speed, allowing users to study both detailed behaviors at normal speed and emergent patterns at accelerated speeds.

## Phase 2: Sparkling Lifecycle Mechanics

### Milestone 2.1: Food Monitoring & Visualization
- [x] Improved visualization of existing food consumption mechanics
- [x] Clear visual indicators for low food states
- [x] Tooltip enhancements for food level monitoring
- [x] Improved UI elements for tracking food resources
- [x] Enhanced visibility of food-related behaviors

**Status**: Completed
**Completion Date**: April 19, 2025
**Notes**: Enhanced food monitoring and visualization by adding visual food level bars with threshold markers, detailed food consumption statistics, and time estimates to the tooltips. The improved tooltip system now shows color-coded food states, consumption rates, and clear indicators for critical hunger states. This makes it easier to monitor Sparkling food levels and anticipate when they need to seek food.

**Context**: This milestone improves user understanding of the food consumption system by providing clear visual indicators and detailed information. These enhancements enable users to better monitor the simulation health and understand Sparkling decision-making related to food resources, which is essential for observing and analyzing the ecosystem dynamics.

### Milestone 2.2: Fadeout & New Sparkling Mechanics
- [x] Gradual fadeout process when both food and neural energy are depleted
- [x] Visual effects for Sparkling fadeout

**Status**: Completed
**Completion Date**: April 20, 2025
**Notes**: Implemented a fadeout process for Sparklings when both food and neural energy are fully depleted. Added visual effects to show the gradual disappearance, including fading opacity, expanding rings, and dissipating particles. Restructured the Sparkling class into a more modular architecture to better support lifecycle features and improve code organization. The fading Sparklings are now automatically removed from the simulation when the fadeout process is complete.

**Context**: This milestone creates a more realistic lifecycle for Sparklings by implementing an elegant exit from the simulation when resources are depleted. The visual fadeout effects provide clear feedback to users about why Sparklings are disappearing, improving the overall understanding of the simulation mechanics. This sets the foundation for the upcoming population replacement features.

### Milestone 2.3: Add new sparklings to replaced those which fade out
- [x] Implement mechanics for new Sparklings to appear

**Status**: Completed
**Completion Date**: April 20, 2025
**Notes**: Implemented mechanisms to spawn new Sparklings when existing ones fade out. Added spawning logic that places new Sparklings in resource-rich areas of the simulation world, while ensuring they're not too close to existing Sparklings. New Sparklings are given a random behavioral profile and spawn with a visual "birth" animation effect that shows expanding rings and sparkles. The spawning system maintains a balanced ecosystem by replacing Sparklings that are removed after fadeout.

**Context**: This milestone creates a dynamic ecosystem with continuous population turnover. As Sparklings fade out due to resource depletion, new ones take their place, maintaining the simulation's energy flow and creating opportunities for observation of different behavioral patterns. This sets the stage for upcoming evolution mechanics in Phase 4.

### Milestone 2.4: Population Control
- [x] Add population control to maintain ecosystem balance
- [x] Implement auto-population control system
- [x] Add min/max population limits
- [x] Create dynamic resource balance calculation
- [x] Implement controlled fadeout for population reduction
- [x] Create UI for population control settings
- [x] Add resource spawn rate adjustment based on population size

**Status**: Completed
**Completion Date**: April 20, 2025
**Notes**: Successfully implemented population control mechanics to maintain ecosystem balance. Added configuration parameters for minimum, target, and maximum population sizes, along with balance range tolerance. Created a resource balance calculation system that assesses resource availability relative to population needs. Implemented controlled fadeout for Sparklings when the population needs to be reduced, prioritizing those with fewer resources. Added a dynamic resource spawn rate that adjusts based on population size to create natural carrying capacity effects. Created a comprehensive UI panel for population control with statistics display and parameter sliders.

**Context**: This milestone completes the Sparkling lifecycle mechanics by creating a balanced ecosystem that maintains stability while still allowing for natural turnover. The population control system prevents both overpopulation (which would deplete resources too quickly) and underpopulation (which would limit interactions and learning), creating ideal conditions for observing emergent behaviors and adaptive strategies. The UI controls give researchers fine-grained control over population dynamics for various experimental scenarios.

### Milestone 2.5: UI and Simulation Parameter Improvements
- [x] Fix control panel blocking debug panel
- [x] Improve resource spawn rate slider functionality
- [x] Reduce Sparklings' food consumption rate
- [x] Increase Sparklings' movement speed

**Status**: Completed
**Completion Date**: April 20, 2025
**Notes**: Implemented several important improvements to the UI and simulation parameters. Redesigned the UI layout to create a draggable, minimizable control panel that never blocks the world map view. The control panel is now positioned in the top-right corner by default and can be dragged anywhere on the screen. Added a minimize button to collapse the panel when needed and organized controls into tabs for better space efficiency. Fixed the resource spawn rate slider functionality that was getting "stuck" at high values by improving its sensitivity and display. Significantly reduced the food consumption rate for Sparklings by 80% to prevent them from consuming food too quickly. Increased Sparkling movement speed by 2.5x to improve the simulation flow and make their movements more visible and engaging.

**Context**: These improvements address user feedback about the simulation interface and parameters. The redesigned UI ensures that users can always see the entire world map while maintaining full access to controls. The draggable panel provides flexibility to position controls wherever they don't obstruct important simulation elements. Parameter adjustments create a more balanced and engaging simulation experience - reduced food consumption makes Sparklings more sustainable, and increased movement speed makes the simulation more dynamic and easier to observe. These changes significantly improve the user experience and the overall balance of the simulation ecosystem.

## Phase 3: Sparkling Inheritance & Evolution

**Context**: This milestone will enhance the user's ability to observe and analyze Sparkling behavior through advanced visualization controls. These tools will enable users to focus on specific aspects of the simulation and track movement and decision patterns more effectively, improving the research and analysis capabilities of the platform.

### Milestone 4.2: Analytics Dashboard
- [ ] Simulation-wide statistics
- [ ] Population charts
- [ ] Resource distribution visualization

**Status**: Not started
**Expected Completion**: May 25, 2025
**Context**: This milestone will provide users with quantitative data and analytics about the simulation. The dashboard will enable the study of population dynamics, resource utilization patterns, and other emergent behaviors across the entire simulation, creating a more comprehensive understanding of the ecosystem as a whole.

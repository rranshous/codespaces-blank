# Sparklings: Version 2 Implementation Progress

This document tracks the implementation progress of Version 2 features for the Sparklings Neural Energy Simulation.

## Phase 1: Simulation Speed Controls

### Milestone 1.1: Speed Multiplier Implementation
- [x] Speed multiplier selector (1x, 2x, 5x, 10x)
- [x] Delta time scaling based on selected speed
- [x] Frame skipping for very high speeds
- [x] Current speed display indicator
- [x] Simulation loop update for variable time steps

**Status**: Completed
**Expected Completion**: April 19, 2025
**Notes**: Implemented speed multiplier functionality with UI controls. Added frame skipping for higher speeds (5x, 10x) to maintain performance. Speed is displayed in the debug panel and buttons highlight the current selection.

## Phase 2: Sparkling Lifecycle Mechanics

### Milestone 2.1: Food Monitoring & Visualization
- [ ] Improved visualization of existing food consumption mechanics
- [ ] Clear visual indicators for low food states
- [ ] Tooltip enhancements for food level monitoring
- [ ] Improved UI elements for tracking food resources
- [ ] Enhanced visibility of food-related behaviors

**Status**: Not started
**Expected Completion**: TBD
**Notes**: This milestone focuses on enhancing the visualization and monitoring of existing food mechanics. Food gathering and consumption behaviors are already implemented in the simulation.

### Milestone 2.2: Fadeout & New Sparkling Mechanics
- [ ] Enhancement of existing food and neural energy relationship
- [ ] Gradual fadeout process when both food and neural energy are depleted
- [ ] Fadeout visual effects
- [ ] Fadeout memory for other Sparklings
- [ ] New Sparkling introduction mechanics
- [ ] Population control balancing

**Status**: Not started
**Expected Completion**: TBD
**Notes**: The basic relationship between food depletion and neural energy consumption is already implemented. This milestone focuses on enhancing this relationship and adding the fadeout mechanics when both resources are depleted.

## Phase 3: Enhanced Visualization & Analytics

### Milestone 3.1: Advanced Visualization Controls
- [ ] Zoom and pan controls
- [ ] Path visualization for movement
- [ ] Memory visualization overlays
- [ ] Animation improvements
- [ ] Selective visualization layers

**Status**: Not started
**Expected Completion**: TBD
**Notes**: 

### Milestone 3.2: Analytics Dashboard
- [ ] Simulation-wide statistics
- [ ] Population charts
- [ ] Resource distribution visualization

**Status**: Not started
**Expected Completion**: TBD
**Notes**: 

## Phase 4: Sparkling Inheritance & Evolution

### Milestone 4.1: Parameter Inheritance
- [ ] Parameter inheritance from successful Sparklings
- [ ] Parameter variation algorithm
- [ ] Parameter lineage visualization
- [ ] Adaptation scoring
- [ ] Parameter evolution history

**Status**: Not started
**Expected Completion**: TBD
**Notes**: 

### Milestone 4.2: Evolution Mechanics
- [ ] Selection pressures based on environment
- [ ] Success metrics for different strategies
- [ ] Branching evolution visualization
- [ ] Trait dominance and recessive mechanics
- [ ] Genetic diversity management

**Status**: Not started
**Expected Completion**: TBD
**Notes**:

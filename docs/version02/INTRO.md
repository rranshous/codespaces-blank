# Sparklings: Neural Energy Simulation - Version 2

## Introduction

Version 2 of the Sparklings Neural Energy Simulation builds upon the solid foundation established in Version 1. With the completion of the core mechanics, neural energy systems, and basic interaction features, Version 2 aims to deepen the emergent behaviors and enhance user experience with more sophisticated systems.

## Vision for Version 2

While Version 1 focused on establishing the foundation and proving core concepts, Version 2 expands on these foundations in several key directions:

1. **Advanced Competition & Territories**: Enhance territorial systems and competition mechanics to create more complex and realistic behaviors between Sparklings.

2. **Sparkling Lifecycle**: Introduce mechanics for Sparkling "fadeout" (a gentler term for when Sparklings cease to exist) when they fail to gather necessary resources, creating natural consequences for resource management.

3. **Population Dynamics**: Implement systems for new Sparklings to appear, maintaining ecosystem balance as others fadeout, creating a full lifecycle simulation.

4. **Simulation Speed Controls**: Add the ability to accelerate simulation time, allowing users to observe long-term developments and emergent behaviors more quickly.

5. **Documentation-First Approach**: Continue the practice of thoroughly documenting features and mechanics before implementation to ensure clear direction and purpose.

## Non-Goals for Version 2

To maintain focus on the core simulation experience, the following are explicitly not prioritized:

1. Performance at scale - The simulation is designed for small-scale observation, not massive populations
2. Development tools or community features - Focus remains on the simulation itself
3. Modular architecture - While code quality is important, architectural flexibility is not a priority

The essence of Version 2 is to create a more complete ecosystem where Sparklings face real consequences for their decisions, form more complex relationships, and evolve behaviors in ways that can be easily observed and appreciated by users.

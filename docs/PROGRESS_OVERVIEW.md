# Sparklings: Project Progress Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the Sparklings Neural Energy Simulation project progress across all versions.

## Version 1 (Completed April 19, 2025)

Version 1 established the core foundation of the Sparklings simulation and successfully implemented:

### Foundation & Core Mechanics
- Development environment setup with TypeScript and Canvas
- Basic simulation loop architecture
- Project structure and organization
- Configuration system for simulation parameters
- 2D grid system with terrain types
- Resource spawning and collection mechanics
- Basic Sparkling entity implementation
- FIFO memory system for resources and encounters

### Intelligence & Decision Making
- Decision parameter system for behavior control
- Neural energy collection and storage
- AI integration with Anthropic API
- Backend proxy for secure inference
- Parameter updating based on inference results

### Basic Competition & Interaction
- Sparkling-to-Sparkling detection
- Resource competition mechanics
- Simple territorial concepts
- Visualization of interactions

### Visualization & UI (Partial)
- World terrain rendering
- Simulation control panel (start/stop)
- Sparkling selection and detailed view
- Debugging panel for internal state

## Version 2 (In Progress - Started April 19, 2025)

Version 2 builds on the Version 1 foundation with the following phased implementation:

### Phase 1: Simulation Speed Controls
- [ ] Speed multiplier selector (1x, 2x, 5x, 10x)
- [ ] Variable time step handling in simulation loop
- [ ] Current speed visualization

### Phase 2: Sparkling Lifecycle Mechanics
- [ ] Energy monitoring visualization improvements
- [ ] Fadeout mechanics for depleted Sparklings
- [ ] New Sparkling introduction mechanics
- [ ] Population balance controls

### Phase 3: Enhanced Visualization & Analytics
- [ ] Advanced visualization controls (zoom, pan, paths)
- [ ] Basic analytics for simulation metrics
- [ ] Environmental and territorial visualization improvements

### Phase 4: Sparkling Inheritance & Evolution
- [ ] Parameter inheritance from successful Sparklings
- [ ] Evolution mechanics with selection pressures
- [ ] Lineage visualization and tracking

## Latest Updates

### April 19, 2025
- Completed Version 1 implementation
- Created Version 2 implementation plan with revised phase priorities
- Updated documentation to reflect streamlined implementation strategy
- Removed detailed analytics features to focus on core functionality
- Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation

## Future Directions

After Version 2 is complete, potential future directions include:
- Advanced evolution mechanics
- More complex social structures
- Narrative generation from simulation events

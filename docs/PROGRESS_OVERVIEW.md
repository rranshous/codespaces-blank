# Sparklings: Project Progress Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the Sparklings Neural Energy Simulation project progress across all versions.

## Version 1 (Completed April 19, 2025)

Version 1 established the core foundation of the Sparklings simulation and successfully implemented:

### Foundation & Core Mechanics
- Development environment setup with TypeScript and Canvas
- Basic simulation loop architecture
- Project structure and organization
- Configuration system for simulation parameters
- 2D grid system with terrain types
- Resource spawning and collection mechanics
- Basic Sparkling entity implementation
- FIFO memory system for resources and encounters

### Intelligence & Decision Making
- Decision parameter system for behavior control
- Neural energy collection and storage
- AI integration with Anthropic API
- Backend proxy for secure inference
- Parameter updating based on inference results

### Basic Competition & Interaction
- Sparkling-to-Sparkling detection
- Resource competition mechanics
- Simple territorial concepts
- Visualization of interactions

### Visualization & UI (Partial)
- World terrain rendering
- Simulation control panel (start/stop)
- Sparkling selection and detailed view
- Debugging panel for internal state

## Version 2 (In Progress - Started April 19, 2025)

Version 2 builds on the Version 1 foundation to create more emergent behaviors and enhanced user experience:

### Advanced Competition & Territories
- [ ] Strategic competition based on resource value
- [ ] Territory enhancements with benefits
- [ ] Resource quality variations and depletion mechanics

### Enhanced User Experience
- [ ] Simulation time controls (speed up/slow down)
- [ ] Analytics dashboard for simulation metrics
- [ ] Enhanced visualization with more detail

### Emergent Behaviors & Adaptation
- [ ] Behavioral adaptation based on experiences
- [ ] Social dynamics between Sparklings
- [ ] Environmental challenges

### Sparkling Lifecycle
- [ ] Fadeout mechanics for resource-deprived Sparklings
- [ ] New Sparkling introduction mechanics
- [ ] Population balance dynamics

## Latest Updates

### April 19, 2025
- Completed Version 1 implementation
- Started planning for Version 2
- Created initial Version 2 documentation

## Future Directions

After Version 2 is complete, potential future directions include:
- Advanced evolution mechanics
- More complex social structures
- Narrative generation from simulation events
